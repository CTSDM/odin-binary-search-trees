# odin-binary-search-trees
Implementation of a binary search tree.
The tree will only consider unique values, and thus will ignore repeated values.
It has the following functionalities:
- Build a tree given an array to the constructor. The array does not need to be sorted.
- Insert, remove, find nodes.
- Print nodes in level, pre-order, in-order or post-order.
- Calculate the height and depth of a given node.
- Check if the level is balanced.
- Rebalance the tree.

## Conclusions
It has been a fun project to work on.
